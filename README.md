This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug involving retain cycles in asynchronous blocks. The bug.m file shows the problematic code, leading to memory leaks.  The bugSolution.m file offers a solution using `__weak` to prevent the retain cycle.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management when working with blocks and asynchronous operations in Objective-C.
